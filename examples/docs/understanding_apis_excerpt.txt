Understanding APIs – SageVault Sample Excerpt
===========================================

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide a contract between clients and servers.
This excerpt outlines three core concepts:

1. **Endpoints** – canonical URLs through which the server exposes functionality.
2. **Status Codes** – three-digit responses such as 200 (success) or 404 (not found).
3. **Payloads** – JSON documents that describe the requested resource or error message.
